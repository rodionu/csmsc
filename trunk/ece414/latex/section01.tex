\section{Introduction}

The objective of this project is to create a working controller that allows a ball on a track to roll from one end of the track to the other without falling off. The control system created here utilizes a four term compensator to drive the plant and a unity feedback scheme. The input to the plant is shaped with a low pass filter to buffer the response of the system. All controller zeroes are placed at least a radial distance of 1 from all plant poles to avoid any unintended pole/zero cancellation.
