\section{Conclusion}
The controller works. It manages to successfully guide the plant in moving the ball to a given position on the track. The initial control effort is fairly high, but it settles out to a  moderate value. With the final design the overshoot is so minimal that the ball will not fall off the track entirely and can in fact be stopped at the target position. While the initial attempts to design the control system using Linear algebraic method was unsuccessful due to the nature of the plant, the latter attempts using a root locus design were quite successful in achieving a workable controller. A more accurate and less wasteful design was completed using the sisotool in MATLAB.
