\section{Introduction}



This project incorporates the ADC similar to as used in lab 7 (reading voltages off of a battery.) However, this project is significantly different in several ways, the objective of this exercise is to create a working digital multimeter that can be used to measure voltages and currents significantly higher than the $V_Ref$ used on the ADC itself. This implementation will also make use of the full 10 bit resolution of the ADC, in order to obtain measurements as accurate as possible.

This report details several sections that work together to create the full multimeter:



\begin{itemize}
\item AVR general port I/O
\item Analog scaling hardware
\item Operating the ADC
\item Postprocessing the ADC return values
\item Writing output to screen
\item AC Signal analysis (Peak detect)
\end{itemize}
