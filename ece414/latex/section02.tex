\section{Gearbox selection}

Selecting the gearbox will change the overall transfer function of the plant, as it modifies components inside the plant. Changing the gearing ratio of the motor adjusts the effective motor torque, similar to changing the motor itself. Gearing ratios were experimented with in order to determine their true effects on the system, while keeping controller poles and zeros fixed (they had already been roughly determined at this point.)
